I'm currently working at [Mindee](https://www.mindee.com/) as a Software Engineer, with a focus on performance and speed
for deep learning models in production. I'm passionate about learning, especially new languages, software security and
new technologies. I'd love to say I'm good at RE but unfortunately x86 is still far from my mother tongue
(all hail [ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) though). I also love Cats,
the French "Nouvelle Vague" and 70s electronic music.
